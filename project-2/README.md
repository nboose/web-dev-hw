### <u> WHAT I DID: </u>
This homework cycle, I started brainstorming instructionals. Ultimately, I decided that writing a step-by-step guide for an easy/beginner zetangle piece would be extremely fun.

### <u> WHAT I LEARNED: </u>

  #### PROBLEMS/ISSUES:
  One problem/issue that I had going into topic-04 was understanding all of the head elements. It took me a lot of time to know what was important to include and what was not -- not to mention the fact that I had to keep flipping views from my project-2 index.html to the topic-04 website! Let me tell ya, there was much digital flurry!

  #### TRIUMPHS:
  A triumph that I had during the writing of index.html, is the fact that I finished it! I get somewhat stressed understanding what is expected of me on the github projects tab. However, I was able to work it out after some time, and wrapped up what was due for 9/25/17.

  #### ADDITIONAL SOURCES I SOUGHT OUT:
  My husband has been my saving grace when it comes to filling in the "coding gaps" that I have when trying to complete the github projects. If I get stuck, its as if I have my own personal tutor to help me out.

  #### HOW THIS WEEK WILL CHANGE MY WORK GOING FORWARD:
  This week, I found that it is very important to be mindful of every line of coding. Each and every thing needs to be in its appropriate place by the time such coding goes live; otherwise, things may not go as successful as planned.
