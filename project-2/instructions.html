      <h1>HOW TO:<br/>EASY ZENTANGLE DESIGN</h1>
        <h2><u>MATERIALS NEEDED</u></h2>
        <p>Although there are a lot of fun zentangle tools out there, <br/>
          when first starting out, it's a good idea to keep things simple. <br/>
          Let's start with just three essentials, which I will list below. <br/>
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Tool Needed</th>
            <th scope="col">Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td scope="row">pencil</td>
            <td scope="row">any #2 pencil (without an eraser!)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td scope="row">black pen</td>
            <td scope="row">0.25mm tip, non-bleeding</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td scope="row">zentangle tile</td>
            <td scope="row">89mm square of fine Italian paper</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
      <h2><u>WHICH TANGLE?</u></h2>
      <p>Today, we are going to study a tangle called the "Cubine".<br/>
        This is a relatively new tangle made by the duo, Ricker Roberts <br/>
        and Maria Thomas. The reason it is called the "Cubine" relates <br/>
        back to the fact that the design looks like a whole bunch of <br/>
        sugar cubes stacked one on top of the other.
      </p>
      <p><i>. . . Now that we know a little bit of our tangle's history, <br/>
        let's jump right in and start drawing!</i><br/>
      </p>
      <h2><u>ILLUSTRATION</u></h2>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> Since tangles have the tendency to be confusing to <br/>
        explain with all the lines, swirls and curves, an illustation is <br/>
        the method of choice when describing the steps for <br/>
        how to do a certain zentangle. <br/>
      </p>
      <p><i>Look closely at the image below. . . </i><br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        You should see some black portions and some red portions. <br/>
        Black portions are lines, swirls and/or curves the artist has <br/>
        already drawn in a previous step. Anything in red is something <br/>
        new that the artist will have to draw to produce the given tangle. <br/>
