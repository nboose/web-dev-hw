      <h1><u>ABOUT ME</u></h1>
      <p id="basic-facts">Hello! My name is Natalie Elizabeth Boose, and I am currently a student at the University of Montana. <br/>
        Right now, I am in my senior year studying for a degree in management & entrepreneurship. My hope, in the future, is to <br/>
        start-up several miscellaneous businesses. So far, so good! If you are in the Missoula area, check out my very first LLC, <br/>
        GOD SHOT ESPRESSO BAR! Drop my name, and you'll get a great deal. :) <br/>
      </p>
      <p id="why-zentangle?"> However, in my spare time, apart from running my very own business and finishing my education, I like <br/>
        to take short breaks to do creative-type things. After all, for an individual to function at optimal levels, it is important <br/>
        to switch from left brain to right brain on a regular basis. Hence, my go-to happy place is Zentangle. Because of this, I <br/>
        I thought I would share a short tangle with my friends here online, to see if it would be something they would enjoy as well. <br/>
      </p>
      <p id="time-frame"> Drawing a zentangle only takes a couple minutes, and can be exactly the thing you need to give your tired <br/>
        mind a break from the tasks of daily life. Please enjoy the short instructional that I have posted, and make sure to post <br/>
        your own creations on the separate page I have provided for you. Thanks! <br/>
      </p>
