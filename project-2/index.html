           comes to instruction a topic that no one else knows very much about.
           Be clear and conscise with every instruction that is given to the reader
           so that he or she can effectly follow in your footsteps
           and produce something that is relatively similar to what he/she is trying to mirror.

      <h10> <u> A WORD OF WISDOM </u> </h10> <br/>
        <q> <i> There are no mistakes in Zentangle. . . <br/>
                If you do not like the look of a stroke you have made, <br/>
                it then becomes only an opportunity to create a new tangle. . . <br/>
                A Zentangle . . . is meant to be a surprise <br/>
                that unfolds before the creator's eyes, <br/>
                one stroke at a time.</i> </q> <sub> <b> ~BECKAH KRAHULA~ </b> </sub>
