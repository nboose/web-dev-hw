# My First README.md
## `By Natalie Elizabeth Boose`
___


### WORK CYCLE SUMMARY:
This homework cycle, I put myself through a tremendous learning curve.
1. I increased my background-knowledge of both the internet and web, and how each one works.
2. I created a filing system for my classwork.![Screenshot Of my Directory](./images/screenshot-1.ong)
2. I figured out how to successfully navigate both programs, Atom and Github (not necessarily in that order).
3. I started my very first README.md after a short test run.
4. And hopefully, I will be learning how to post this to GitHub to complete this portion of my assignment. *YAY!* *Actually not yay. I scared myself silly after writing the earlier parts of this document because I originally thought the most recent version of this document did not load to GitHub.*


### PROBLEMS/ISSUES:
One issue I had upon opening up ATOM was the fact that I immediately clicked out of the welcome tab and my handy-dandy toolbar at the top of the page. It took me a very long time, consequently, to figure out how to change my settings manually, install the suggested themes and packages, and finally pull up a new, blank project! Thank goodness for my husband who showed me that Ctrl Shift P brings up all the buttons for the program! *Sigh of relief*.

### LEARNING INTERESTS:
+ I am still trying to figure out how to indent my paragraphs, and this would be something I am interested in learning/figuring out in the future.
+ I would also like to discover how to color-code my text (so the color shows up on the preview) because I'd prefer for my future websites to catch the eye of the reader!

### ISSUE POSTINGS:
As of right now, I have not posted any of the problems or issues that I have had during this project, partially because I was able to figure everything out given enough time and tinkering. I will, however, be posting next project, as I have full faith there **WILL** be something that I do not understand!

I should probably post a link to the GitHub issues tab for future reference . . .
