         <p class="one"> I am Dan Coppersmith, the poet, photographer, healer and teacher behind the inspirational works presented here on this site. <br/></p>
         <p class="one"> I started this journey of self-esteem advocacy when I woke up one day and found that I was living a life of who I thought I was <br/>
           supposed to be (good provider, hard worker, etc), but I had lost the inner peace of full self-expression.Â  I was missing the joy <br/>
           that comes from just being who you are. <br/></p>
         <p class="one"> I embarked on an adventure of self-discovery and personal improvement that allowed me to let go of many limiting <br/>
           beliefs and opened me to new possibilities. <em>. . . Imagine a 19-year veteran of Test Engineering in the <br/>
           very logic-oriented semiconductor industry suddenly leaving my corporate job and taking art classes and writing poetry!</em><br/></p>
         <p class="one"> After 40 plus years of doing what I was told, I was finally discovering who I am and the brilliance inside of me. <br/>
           I like what I found! <br/></p>
