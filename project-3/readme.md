# My Third README.md
## `By Natalie Elizabeth Boose`

#### 1. I would like to do a book showcase!
#### 2. I will do a site for Dan Coppersmith's book, <u>The Elusive Here and Now.</u><br/> The snippet I will use from the book will be one of Dan's poems entitled, "A Reminder." <br/>

<center><i> I am enough <br/>
Just me alone <br/>
With no oneâ€™s approval <br/>
Only my own <br/></i>

<center><i> I am complete <br/>
With no need for more <br/>
Containing within me <br/>
An infinite store  <br/></i>

<center><i> I am abundance <br/>
I am magic and light <br/>
I am creation <br/>
I am joy and delight <br/></i>

<center><i> I am Source of it all <br/>
I am boundless, and yet <br/>
Being still human <br/>
Sometimes I forget. <br/></i>

#### 3. The following page gives a complete bio on Dan Coppersmith. <br/> I will most likely cite this on my site.  http://www.dancoppersmith.com/about.html
#### 4. The following page gives a couple of reviews on Dan Coppersmith's book <br/> -- I will most likely use a couple on my own site. http://spiritwire.com/elusive.html
#### 5. [click here for my potential color pallete](.../images/color_pallet.png) The reason I chose this color pallete is because it mirrors the idea that the way I was created is enough-- nature, being natural, is all that I need.
#### 6. For this project I will be using two different fonts -- first, I will use Yellowtail at 94pt for titles. Second, I will use Open Sans (bold 22pt & light 14pt) for headings and body content. I choose these options after surfing pinterst for aesthetically-pleasing typography combos.
